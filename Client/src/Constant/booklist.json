      "longDescription": "Windows has an easy-to-use interface, but if you want to automate it, life can get hard. That is, unless you use PowerShell, an elegant new dynamic language from Microsoft designed as an all-purpose Windows scripting tool. PowerShell lets you script administrative tasks and control Windows from the command line. Because it was specifically developed for Windows, programmers and power-users can now do things in a shell that previously required VB, VBScript, or C#.    Windows PowerShell in Action was written by Bruce Payette, one of the founding members of the Windows PowerShell team, co-designer of the PowerShell language and the principal author of the PowerShell language implementation. From him you will gain a deep understanding of the language and how best to use it, and you'll love his insights into why PowerShell works the way it does.    This book is a tutorial for sysadmins and developers introducing the PowerShell language and its environment. It shows you how to build scripts and utilities to automate system tasks or create powerful system management tools to handle the day-to-day tasks that drive a Windows administrator's life.

The most important is a description of P1363, an IEEE draft standard for public key cryptography.    The main purpose of Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography is to help \"crypto engineers\" implement functioning, state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms in the minimum time. With detailed descriptions of the mathematics, the reader can expand on the code given in the book and develop optimal hardware or software for their own applications.    Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography assumes the reader has at least a high school background in algebra, but it explains, in stepwise fashion, what has been considered to be a topic only for graduate-level students.

      "longDescription": "SOA   Service Oriented Architecture   has become the leading solution for complex, connected business systems. While it's easy to grasp the theory of SOA, implementing well-designed, practical SOA systems can be a difficult challenge. Developers and enterprise architects still face the following issues:        * How to get high-availability with SOA      * How to know a service has failed      * How to create reports when data is scattered within multiple services      * How to increase the loose coupling of your SOA      * How to solve authentication and authorization for service consumers--internal and external      * How to integrate SOA and the UI      * How to avoid common SOA pitfalls      * How to choose technologies that increase the performance of your services    In SOA Patterns, author Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz provides detailed, technology-neutral solutions to these challenges, and many others. This book provides architectural guidance through patterns and anti-patterns. It shows you how to build real SOA services that feature flexibility, availability, and scalability. Through an extensive set of patterns, this book identifies the major SOA pressure points and provides reusable techniques to address them. Each pattern pairs the classic Problem/Solution format with a unique technology map, showing where specific solutions fit into the general pattern.    SOA Patterns shows you how to address common SOA concerns, including the areas of performance, availability, scalability, security, management, service interaction, user interface interaction, and service aggregation. The SOA anti-patterns part shows you how to avoid common mistakes and how to refactor broken systems. The book also maps quality attributes to patterns so that you can easily find the patterns relevant to your problems.    WHAT'S INSIDE:        * Details more than 30 patterns for common SOA scenarios in the areas of security, performace, availability, UI integration, service aggregation and service interaction      * Describes more than 20 SOA pitfalls to avoid      * Spotlights the architecural perspective on SOA      * Explains technology mapping from conceptual solution to current technologies      * Provides extensive and practical advice on matching patterns to technologies  ",

      "longDescription": "Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design technique emphasizing Separation of Concerns, Modularity, Extensibility and Testability. Applied well, it enables programmers to successfully deal with complexity in software and add new features to existing apps with greater ease. DI is the key to writing modular software and producing flexible and maintainable code bases.    While well-known among Java developers and other practitioners of object-oriented design, DI is only now gaining momentum in the .NET community. The Unity container released by Microsoft patterns & practices and the new Microsoft Extensibility Framework (MEF) make DI more relevant than ever for .NET developers.    Dependency Injection in .NET is a comprehensive guide than introduces DI and provides an in-depth look at applying DI practices to .NET apps. In it, you will also learn to integrate DI together with such technologies as Windows Communication Foundation, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Presentation Foundation and other core .NET components.    Building on your existing knowledge of C# and the .NET platform, this book will be most beneficial for readers who have already built at least a few software solutions of intermediate complexity. Most examples are in plain C# without use of any particular DI framework. Later, the book introduces several well-known DI frameworks, such as StructureMap, Windsor and Spring.NET. For each framework, it presents examples of its particular usage, as well as examines how the framework relates to the common patterns presented earlier in the book.    WHAT'S INSIDE        * A thorough introduction to DI principles applied to .NET development      * Numerous C#-based examples      * A comprehensive catalog of Patterns and Anti-Patterns      * Understand the importance of loose coupling      * Learn DI Containers including StructureMap, Windsor, Spring.NET and the Microsoft Extensibility Framework      * Identify and avoid common traps",

When using the utility to configure Java applets, you do not need to know any Java programming or even any HTML programming. All you do is change the value of a parameter and click on a button to see the resulting change to the applet. The applet configuration utility is written in Java and runs in your browser, so it runs on any computer platform for which there is a Java-enabled browser.

Its much-improved replacement, C++/CLI, now provides an effective bridge between the native and managed programming worlds. Using this technology, developers can combine existing C++ programs and .NET applications with little or no refactoring. Accessing .NET libraries like Windows Forms, WPF, and WCF from standard C++ is equally easy.    C++/CLI in Action is a practical guide that will help you breathe new life into your legacy C++ programs. The book begins with a concise C++/CLI tutorial. It then quickly moves to the key themes of native/managed code interop and mixed-mode programming. You   ll learn to take advantage of GUI frameworks like Windows Forms and WPF while keeping your native C++ business logic.

Eric Siber, Developpez.com",
      "longDescription": "Agile principles have been a breath of fresh air to many development teams stuck in the middle of a rigid, process-driven environment. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to bring Agile into an existing organization with established people and practices. Becoming Agile shows you practical techniques and strategies to move from your existing process to an Agile process without starting from scratch.    Many books discuss Agile from a theoretical or academic perspective. Becoming Agile takes a different approach and focuses on explaining Agile from a ground-level point-of-view. Author Greg Smith, a certified ScrumMaster with dozens of Agile projects under his belt, presents Agile principles in the context of a case study that flows throughout the book.    Becoming Agile focuses on the importance of adapting Agile principles to the realities of your environment. While Agile purists have often discouraged a    partial-Agile    approach, the reality is that in many shops a    purist    approach simply isn't a viable option. Over the last few years, Agile authorities have begun to discover that the best deployments of Agile are often customized to the specific situation of a given company.  As well, Becoming Agile addresses the cultural realities of deploying Agile and how to deal with the needs of executives, managers, and the development team during migration. The author discusses employee motivation and establishing incentives that reward support of Agile techniques.    Becoming Agile will show you how to create a custom Agile process that supports the realities of your environment. The process will minimize risk as you transition to Agile iteratively, allowing time for your culture and processes to acclimate to Agile principles.",

      "longDescription": "Modern distributed architectures require a secure, reliable way to exchange messages in asynchronous, loosely-coupled systems. For Java developers, the Java Message Service (JMS) provides that core functionality. The Apache ActiveMQ message broker is a complete open source implementation of the JMS specification. The ActiveMQ Message-Oriented Middleware, coupled with its Enterprise Integration Provider are the building blocks of an Enterprise Service Bus   the backbone of a contemporary Service Oriented Architecture.    ActiveMQ is implemented in Java, but it supports client applications written in many other programming languages including C/C++, .NET, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Python, and more. It can be integrated with other open source frameworks including Tomcat, ServiceMix, JBoss, and can easily bridge to other JMS providers.    Apache ActiveMQ in Action is a thorough, practical guide to implementing message-oriented systems in Java using ActiveMQ. The book lays out the core of ActiveMQ in clear language, starting with the anatomy of a JMS message and moving quickly through connectors, message persistence, authentication and authorization. With the basics well in hand, you move into interesting examples of ActiveMQ at work, following a running Stock Portfolio application. You'll integrate ActiveMQ with containers like Geronimo and JBoss and learn to tie into popular Java-based technologies like Spring Framework.    Along the way, you'll pick up best practices forged out of the deep experience the authors bring to the book. You'll learn to integrate with non-Java technologies and explore advanced topics like broker topologies and configuration and performance tuning.    Additionally, the book will introduce readers to using Apache Camel with Apache ActiveMQ as a way to easily utilize the Enterprise Integration Patterns.",

Today, most developers acknowledge the benefits of unit testing and rely on the increasingly sophisticated tools now available. The recently released JUnit 4.5 represents the state of the art in unit testing frameworks, and provides significant new features to improve the Java development process.    JUnit in Action, Second Edition is an up-to-date guide to unit testing Java applications (including Java EE applications) using the JUnit framework and its extensions. This book provides techniques for solving real-world problems such as testing AJAX applications, using mocks to achieve testing isolation, in-container testing for Java EE and database applications, and test automation.    Written to help readers exploit JUnit 4.5, the book covers recent innovations such as the new annotations that simplify test writing, improved exception handling, and the new assertion methods. You'll also discover how to use JUnit extensions to test new application styles and frameworks including Ajax, OSGi, and HTML-based presentation layers.    Using a sample-driven approach, various unit testing strategies are covered, such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications, and web applications. Also addressed are testing strategies using freely available open source frameworks and tools, and how to unit test in isolation with Mock Objects. The book will also bring you up to speed on the latest thinking in TDD, BDD, Continuous Integration, and other practices related to unit testing.  ",

      "longDescription": "For enterprise Java developers, Spring Framework provides remarkable improvements in developer productivity, runtime performance, and overall application quality. Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That's where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \"the Spring way\" by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You're never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don't have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you'll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you're new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you're building. You'll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you'll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE. Prior exposure to Spring Framework is helpful, but not required.",

      "longDescription": "It seems like we're all being asked to multi-task more than ever   and our computers are no exception to this trend. Multiple processors with multiple cores running multiple threads is quickly becoming the norm. C++ developers will have to master the principles, techniques, and new language features supporting concurrency to stay ahead of the curve.    With the new C++ Standard and Technical Report 2 (TR2), multi-threading is coming to C++ in a big way. There is a new memory model with support for multiple threads, along with a new multi-threading support library featuring low-level atomic operations, as well as basic thread launching and synchronization facilities. TR2 will provide higher-level synchronization facilities that allow for a much greater level of abstraction, and make programming multi-threaded applications simpler and safer.    C++ Concurrency in Action is the first book to show you how to take advantage of the new C++ Standard and TR2 to write robust multi-threaded applications in C++.    As a guide and reference to the new concurrency features in the upcoming C++ Standard and TR, this book is invaluable for existing programmers familiar with writing multi-threaded code in C++ using platform-specific APIs, or in other languages, as well as C++ programmers who have never written multi-threaded code before.    If you're a programmer accustomed to writing single-threaded applications, C++ Concurrency in Action will show you how to write your new parallel algorithm in C++. You'll learn to avoid many of the pitfalls associated with writing multi-threaded applications. You can also use this book to quickly transfer your platform-specific knowledge to the new Standard C++ threading library, enabling you to use a single API on both systems and simplify your code.",

      "longDescription": "Although CGI scripts provide 80% of today's server side processing, they are slow, inefficient, and memory-hungry. A new species is evolving to take their place, one which is lean, fast, portable, and easy to maintain: Java servlets.    Servlets are not merely an alternative to CGI, for they can do much more. Servlets have opened the door to a world of client/server applications that would have been too difficult or too time-consuming to consider before.    Java Servlets: By Example takes the reader into the world of servlets, moving example by example from the simple to the complex. An early chapter explains the simple HTML form processing through servlets. A later chapter shows how to connect a Java applet to a servlet, which is itself connected to a database.    Java Servlets: By Example is full of real-world, ready-to-run example code. Each chapter deals with a new problem and takes the reader through a series of servlet-based solutions. However, the book is detailed enough that it may also serve as a reference for the developer.",

With Node you access HTTP and TCP/IP functionality through a minimalist server-side Javascript interface. It supports an asynchronous programming model that enables the web server to more easily do more than one thing at a time, a key requirement for real-time applications such as chat, online games, and live statistics. And since it's JavaScript, you'll use the same language throughout your entire application.\n\nNode.js in Action is an example-driven tutorial that starts at square one and guides you through all the features, techniques, and concepts you'll need to build production-quality Node applications. You'll start by learning how to set up your Node development environment, including loading the community-created extensions. Next, you'll run several simple demonstration programs where you'll learn the basics of a few common types of Node applications. Then you'll dive into asynchronous programming, a model Node leverages to lessen application bottlenecks.\n\nWith the basics under your belt, you're ready to start building serious web applications using Node's HTTP API. You'll explore data storage, application deployment, and output templating, and you'll discover community frameworks that make web development easier and faster. Along the way, you'll learn to interact with the filesystem and to create non-HTTP applications, such as TCP/IP servers and command-line tools.\n\nMuch of the Node ecosystem is open source, so this book will show you how the community works and how you can contribute. You'll learn about the NPM Repository, where most community extensions reside, and you'll learn how to publish your own extensions. In addition, the book outlines online resources for getting help with any stumbling blocks you run into during your journey as a Node developer.\nWHAT'S INSIDE",
